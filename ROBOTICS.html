                Maiz Bot: Autonomous Vacuum Bot
            </h1>
            <p style = "padding-left: 4px">
                Our goal for this project is to create an autonomous 
                vacuum that can clean in any environment it is placed in, 
                similar and inspired by a Roomba. This entails the robot 
                to be able to detect and avoid obstacles that it cannot 
                clear, such as toys or certain furniture, and detect 
                obstacles it can go under and clean, like table chairs 
                and things of the like. Our robot will rely on 2D-LIDAR 
                to sense and create a map of its surroundings, as well as 
                know its own location in a given room. The LIDAR will also
                perform avoidance in a situation where it bumps into an 
                obstacle or wall and needs to pivot. 
                It will use two wheels as its effectors, and have a vacuum 
                box mounted under it to collect the debris it passes over. 
                Lastly, the robot will move in a spiral manner where 
                it starts in the center and works its way through the space 
                avoiding obstacles.

                    03/04 - This is our robot body with the DC Motors in place. 
                    This form is only temporary while the 3D printer is broken.

                    04/04 - This is our robot with the motor driver, motors, 
                    raspberry pi and lidar connected.It also has a third back 
                    wheel for support. We will have a laser cut acrylic board 
                    instead of cardboard.

                    04/26 - This is our robot with the laser cut acrylic board, 
                    as well as the Pi, motor driver, voltage regulator, and motor 
                    driver. The underside is also fitted with a voltage regulator
                    for the vacuum, the vacuum itself, and a battery pack.

                    05/1 - This is our finished robot. There is now a LIPO attached, bus, 
                    and completed wiring. The code has been uploaded to a seperate repo. 
                    Attached below is a video demo of it moving through the colony space,
                    as well as a video of it moving with its spiral capabilities.
